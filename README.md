### why this script ?
Sometimes you enter a hostile network and you feel insecure .. well, put this script next to your firewall and put a port usually in a range between 81 - 8081 .. and see if you have any service like 'nmap' scanning the port in question which you uploaded .. and keep monitoring ..or block.
